# hello-world

In a web design course I would like to enhance my design abilitie, but first of all I would like to learn how to create and design web pages. I was interested in that since a long time ago and finally I can learn how to code web pages properly. For now I do it because of my interest but who knows maybe in the future I will really like that and this will become my main occupation.
